        <p>
          The Vietnamese revolution cannot be separated from the task of national 
          liberation. And in that, the task of preserving culture and tradition is of 
          immense importance. This preservation is the preservation of the Vietnamese 
          culture and traditions as a whole, and also of the ethnic minorities within 
          our nation. This preserving of culture means building a united national 
          community, a class community around the idea of the Vietnamese nation and its 
          traditions.

      <section id="Ý thức dân tộc và giai cấp">
        <h2>National and class consciousness</h2>
        <p> Through culture and tradition, people find their roots, and a common 
          root goes a long way in bringing the working men and women together and 
          creating within it is a sense of community – forming a class/national identity. 
          From within the (this) national identity, solidarity and class consciousness 
          emerge, hence collective action emerges. This concept of the solidarity of 
          people can only emerge in them through a common understanding – a sharing - 
          of their common culture, common language, common historical experience – 
          all that cultivates into one’s shared lived experience. 
          <br>
          In the case of Vietnam, that national identity emerged from the understanding 
          (the empathy and understanding from person to person) through common history,
           a common culture, a common origin, and common struggle – the class 
           struggle – the most recent and most uniting force. All of which seems like 
           separate entities, but are in fact one, under the specific historical context 
           of Vietnam. The long struggles for class and national liberation for Vietnam 
           has been the uniting force for such. Such struggles resulting in the sense 
           of lineage – the pride in one’s ancestors, and the class struggle being two 
           but one. The essence of tradition is now in the essence of common lived 
           experienced, from which a common consciousness is built.

        <h2>Relate the poem "The Nation" from which to deduce the point of view of the national will</h2>
        <img class="content-image" src="https://www.thivien.net/attachment/nckhpZ5CJB9KJxE1GJYkOA.1126984654.jpg" alt="nguyen-khoa-diem" width="20%">
        <h3>Poet Nguyễn Khoa Điềm. Image: Thi Viện </h3>
      <p>
        Such consciousness while seemingly distant and sublime, 
        is nothing but close and real. The national consciousness, 
        which in itself is class consciousness is real and perhaps more 
        real than anything. Such consciousness find its essence in everyday 
        objects. Famous Vietnamese revolutionary poet Nguyen Khoa Diem once 
        wrote:<br><br>
        Khi ta lớn lên Đất Nước đã có rồi<br>
        (When we were born The Nation is already there)<br>
        Đất Nước có trong những cái “ngày xửa ngày xưa...” mẹ thường hay kể<br>
        (The Nation is there in the rhymes of old times mom used to sing)<br>
        Đất Nước bắt đầu với miếng trầu bây giờ bà ăn<br>
        (The Nation starts with the betel nut grandma is chewing)<br>
        Đất Nước lớn lên khi dân mình biết trồng tre mà đánh giặc<br>
        (The Nation grows whem our people learned to grow bamboos to fight off invaders)<br>
        Tóc mẹ thì bới sau đầu<br>
        (Mom's hair tied back into a bun (indicating labor))<br>
        Cha mẹ thương nhau bằng gừng cay muối mặn(0)<br>
        (Mom and dad loved each other through thick and thin)("gừng cay muối mặn"(0) means 
        Spicy ginger, salty salt, same expression as the English "thick and thin")<br>
        Cái kèo, cái cột thành tên<br>
        (The truss, the collumn now has names (functionalities))(indicating the labor of building (a home), of construction)<br>
        Hạt gạo phải một nắng hai sương xay, giã, giần, sàng<br>
        (Rice grains must be milled, pounded, grounded, sieved)(also indicating labour)<br>
        Đất Nước có từ ngày đó...<br>
        (The Nation exists from then)(from labour)<br><br>
        Đất (1) là nơi anh đến trường<br>
        (The Nation is where I went to school)("Đất (1)" in Vietnamese means the ground)<br>
        Nước là nơi em tắm<br>
        (THe nation is your showers)("Nước(2)" in Vietnamese means water)<br>
        Đất Nước là nơi ta hò hẹn<br>
        (The nation is where we started dating)(When put "Đất"(1) and "Nước"(2) together get "Đất Nước" (land and sea) meaning "the nation"<br>
        ...<br><br>
        The common consciousness, which is (manifested in) the national spirit lies 
        in everyday objects, events, phenomena (material objects): the nation is where 
        I went to school (đất là nơi anh đến trường), the nation is where we started 
        dating (đất nước là nơi ta hò hẹn), … And hence the national spirit transcends 
        the everyday objects, into the ultimate will of the people who share and who 
        have shared such experience. That common experience is like a common strain 
        connecting the living spirit, the spirits that will live and the spirit of the 
        death, creating a sense of lineage: “The nation is already there we were born”. 
        Our people, our children and our ancestors are the nation and the nation is our 
        people, our children and our ancestors, one is intrinsically the other, one in 
        all, all in one. The national, the tradition and the personal are hence fused 
        into one single entity that subsumes everything, itself becoming THE totality 
        of existence, that of both “sein” (being) and “dasein” (being-there).

<p>
  The nation then gains class characteristics for the people holds class characteristics 
  – the nation is the class, the class is the nation, so on and so forth. And inseparable 
  from that (the nation), is the common culture and traditions, as a person is but his 
  relations to others, and to that end, his relation to his past generations is presence 
  in himself, in his class, in his nation, as explained above.

        <h2>Analysis of views of Marx and later Ho Chi Minh on tradition
        </h2>
        <p>
          Relating to this, Karl Marx once wrote: <br><br>
          “The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare 
          on the brains of the living.”<br><br>
          This is written in “The Eighteen Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte”, and it as 
          well as a lot of excerpts from this work should be understood as a 
          criticism of tradition. In the sense of tradition being a potential force of 
          oppression from the ruling order preventing the oppressed class from 
          gaining revolutionary consciousness and preventing social changes and 
          progress. But this is in no way a total reaction against tradition as a 
          whole, and it would be naïve to claim that all traditions hitherto is 
          nothing but oppressive customs. History has proven the fact that tradition 
          can come from the oppressed class – the people (volk) – in the sense of 
          folk traditions, folklores and folk tales, traditional hymns, farming 
          songs (đồng dao) … as much and perhaps more so than it is from the ruling 
          class. What can be taken from Marx, however, is the claim that tradition 
          can have large influence on the forming of a class identity.
        </p>

        <img class="content-image" src="https://a.tcnn.vn//Images/images/Bac%20Ho.jpg" alt="ho-chi-minh" width="60%">
        <h3>During the process of leading the revolution, the Party and President 
          Ho Chi Minh "... brought into full play the strength of solidarity and 
          struggle of the whole Vietnamese nation, promoting all the beautiful traditions 
          of the nation. from thousands of years ago. The past comes to life more 
          beautifully than ever in the epic of the present, and the present is 
          sowing precious seeds for bright tomorrows.”<br>
          - Prime Minister Pham Van Dong
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ho Chi Minh later much clarified this view, taking on a more reserved, but 
          no less revolutionary perspective on tradition. Ho Chi Minh was keen on 
          preserving traditional cultural practices, festivals, respecting the previous 
          generations’ achievements and learning from their heroics, while at the same 
          time being fervently against the more backwards customs, which he correctly 
          deemed as tools of the ruling class in proper Marxist fashion. This is the 
          perspective that the Communist Party and our people have chosen, and one 
          that our movement must choose.<br>
          From this Marxist and Ho Chi Minh thought perspective, we can infer that 
          understanding and preserving culture – that is understanding how and why 
          such tradition came about from a critical perspective - and practice such 
          tradition if such is positive, and to disregard that tradition if it is 
          oppressive must be a force for good. Regardless, it is of immense task to 
          study the culture and tradition of a people as a way to understand such 
          people and their specific historical context in a Marxist sense, to use 
          as a necessary tool to unite the mass, and to use such as a ground to move 
          forward.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The 21st Century is and will be a century of hardship for class and national 
          liberation in Vietnam and also worldwide. The force of neo-feudalism still 
          ravages and will continue to ravage, and with its tactic of co-opting Marxist 
          and socialist mode of thoughts into its anti-fragility structure, it comes 
          to attack what is most near and dear to the working class, and then the 
          working class itself. One of such that the neo-feudalist machine is trying 
          to sabotage is tradition. By distorting and then using Marxist and socialist 
          narratives, it cast a false light on tradition, calling it a wholly oppressive 
          force, and put in place of tradition a liberation of a false class (the 
          intersectionists, the transvestites, the sexually oppressed?) against the 
          oppression of another false class (the cis hetero young men), directing the 
          eyes of the mass away from the true material dialectic of true class struggle 
          for the modes and means of production, weakening the bonds within the 
          oppressed people, making them weak and passive both as individuals and as a 
          collective- all with the final aim of total reification and 
          commodification.<br><br>
          Facing this threat, we as a collective should stay firm in our belief of 
          tradition as a tool to unite the working class, a force for liberation 
          when used correctly, and be ready to point out any form of rejecting, 
          defamation against tradition for the sake of false “progress” under false 
          dialectics, correctly identifying forms of deviation and degradation as 
          forces of neo-feudalist capitalism. At the same time, we should be ready 
          to embrace changes made to culture and traditions that can be fruitful in 
          improving the lives of the people and aide in the liberation of the working 
          nation from old and backwards habits rooted in the old feudal age.
