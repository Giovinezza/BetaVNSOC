        <p> The Communist Party of Vietnam is the only entity with enough political power to make revolutionary changes, with an aim to improve the lives of the working nation. The Communist Party of Vietnam was, has been and will also be the only entity through which the voice of the people is heard the loudest – the reason making the party an unyielding collective. The Communist Party with the dictatorship of the Proletariat and socialistic model hence hold the same aims as we the people, that is the aim of equality – democracy – strong people – strong nation.</p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p>  The Communist Party of Vietnam is the face of Vietnamese Revolution, the face of proletarian revolution, and national liberation revolution. History has shown greatly the role that the Party play, and the truth that the Communist Party of Vietnam has as much power and strength today is echoing the fact that such is a necessary and unavoidable outcome of history, starting from the inevitable need of the nation to rise up against colonialism, against feudalism, monarchism, and achieve national independence.</p>
        <p>  The Communist Party of Vietnam has proven its competence through revolutionary and modern reforms, supporting the common man, but not falling for the trap of liberalism, neo-liberalism, Trotskyism, reactionaries and neo-progressives (woke). The Communist Party of Vietnam, throughout its history, has kept its revolutionary essence, not turning to conservatism, not going to decline, but raising the flag of revolution to march onwards and achieve greatness. Under the guiding force of the Party, the Vietnamese economy has become one of the fastest growing in the region and the world. Vietnam grew from a poor nation with an uneducated population, to a nation with immense economic potential, an education system which produces model and global citizens, deserving of the old Vietnamese civilizational feats.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>  Throughout the whole revolution, the Party has reformed the nation to one that is worth living in for its citizens, with a stable and improving economy, a strong national defense, a safe, stable, and harmonious society. This – the revolutionary essence – is one that is worth learning from for both us – the writers, and you – the readers.</p>
        <p>  The ideal and the theory underlying the Party is also one that is most fitting for the Vietnamese nation. It is the only theory that has been trialed and tested under fire, through the reality of running a great nation. Until now, it has proven its righteousness. This underlying theory, is a sharp synthesis of Marxism-Leninism, Ho Cho Minh thought, and the national spirit, applying the national spirit and synthesizing it with the proletarian spirit, in the words of Marx:</p>
        <p>  "(The proletariats) must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word"</p>

        <h3>Tuyên ngôn của đảng Cộng sản - C.Mác, Ăngghen, 1848</h3>
        <p> The national and Vietnamese aspects of the theory has been important parts contributing to the supremacy of the Vietnamese Communist Party over those of the Trotskyists, the revisionists, who tries to degrade the achievements of the revolution in Vietnam, the October Revolution of Lenin, or the Great Patriotic War under Stalin.</p>
        <p>  Ha Huy Tap once wrote: “Abolishing the national interest is to isolate the proletariat, but it is also a betrayal of internationalism"</p>

        <p> Marching onwards to the third decade of the 21st Century, Vietnam has to face new challenges, coming from without and within. Western capitalism is also entering a new stage of development, advancing to its "neo-feudal" form, and with it brings with it more sophisticated methods of interpenetration such as woke radicalism, eco fascism, neo - progressivism, etc. .. with approaches much more dangerous than the “peaceful and democratic struggle” movements of the past.<br>

        The proletarian movements must therefore also change themselves to adapt to these new forms of coercion. And we hope that our voices can contribute to that adaptation, starting from the smallest things - our influence from us - the writers, to you - the readers, or members of the movement. In order to do that, one of the important factors is that we - as Vietnamese citizens - must learn from, build om and promote the ideals of the Communist Party of Vietnam, study and follow Ho Chi Minh's ideals. All of which we have been doing, but still, we need to be more conscious.</p>
