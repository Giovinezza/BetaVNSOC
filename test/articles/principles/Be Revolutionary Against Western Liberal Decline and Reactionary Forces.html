        <p>Keeping the revolutionary spirit in the face of the manifestations of the decline of the West and reactionary forces is indispensable in the process of 
          national construction and socialist construction in order to improve the living standards of the working people and to maintain national safety and security.</p>   
      </section>
      <section id="thân">
        <h2></h2>
        <p>First, it is necessary to grasp the definition of reactionary. Reactionaries are not simply forces that oppose the state of Vietnam or those who 
          disagree on ideology or political views. Reactionary is a phrase in philosophy, referring to the ideas, movements, systems, etc. that go against 
          the revolution. This means that reactionary ideologies, movements, and systems will tend to preserve the working mechanism of the current society, 
          return to the working mechanism of the previous society, and basically stand against the inevitable changes in history. For this reason, most 
          social movements in the West, regardless of such being branded "Left Wing" or "Right Wing", progressive or conservative, all have the essence of 
          "reactionary", all stemming from the bourgeois system.</p>
        <p>The conservative movements, with their patriarchal, chauvinistic and sometimes monarchical framework of thinking usually hide themselves under the banner 
          of tradition, of national, cultural, familial values, values that are good and true, to hide away their conservative, backward thinking, refusing to change, 
          and hence reactionary essence. They willingly though sometimes unintentionally equate bourgeois nationalism (which they just refer to as nationalism) &ndash; 
          an outdated and repressive ideology - and the proletarian nationalism &ndash; a revolutionary breakthrough - that Ho Chi Minh has chosen.</p>
        <p>Colonel, Associate Professor, PhD, Deputy Director of the Military Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities, Ministry of National Defense Duong Quoc 
          Dung wrote in the article "The Nationalism in Ho Chi Minh's thought is actually proletarian nationalism.":</p>
        <p>&ldquo;National independence associated with socialism is the central thesis, the core content of Ho Chi Minh's thought. Ho Chi Minh's thought on 
          national independence associated with socialism is a contribution of the Vietnamese revolution to the treasure of Marxism-Leninism, to the theory 
          of social revolution in the current era. The revolutionary practice has proved that the necessary, possible and real cause of national liberation 
          in Vietnam has been resolved according to the stance of the proletariat and nationalism in Ho Chi Minh's thought, is in fact proletarian nationalism.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>"The thesis that "the essence of Ho Chi Minh's thought is nationalism" is an inaccurate, incomplete, and distorted way of understanding and 
          expressing his thoughts. That false argument goes against the interests of the working class, the working people, and the Vietnamese nation, and denies 
          Ho Chi Minh's thought on national independence associated with socialism - an ideology that holds command over strategic leadership throughout the process 
          of the Vietnamese revolution. It is clear that this thesis wants Vietnam to give up the banner of national independence and socialism, abandon the path that 
          our nation has chosen, the path that the nation has sacrificed for, for more than 80 years under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam."</p>
      <p>Quote from: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/chi-tiet-tim-kiem/-/2018/12006/chu-nghia-dan-toc-trong-tu-tuong-ho-chi-minh-thuc-chat-la-chu-nghia-dan-toc-vo-san.aspx">
        The Nationalism in Ho Chi Minh's thought is actually proletarian nationalism</a>
      </p>
      </h3>
      <p>And these same forces do not understand the nature of bourgeois nationalism, and the national proletariat, they bring to Vietnam the notions of foreign 
        traditions, impose it on Vietnam, without rejecting or not paying attention to the specific historical context of each nation, country. Marx also mentioned 
        conservative thought as a reactionary force:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Nay more, they (the conservatives) are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance, they are revolutionary, they 
        are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future interests, they desert their 
        own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.</p>

      <h3> Quote: Manifesto of the Communist Party, Marx, Engels, 1848</h3>
      <p>In contrast, reactionary movements sometimes brand themselves, coat themselves in revolutionary language to cover up their counter-revolutionary 
        elements, whether intentional or not. We have seen this clearly with movements such as the New Left and Trotskyites of the 20th century, and it is 
        not surprising that this tactic of misleading continues to be used even today, intentionally or not, by a series of radical, pro-Western movements. 
        These movements may even use Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong thought, or even Ho Chi Minh's thought as smoke and mirrors, transforming and distorting 
        the above ideas to suit their propagational interests. These movements are the most dangerous, because they to appear on the surface as revolutionary, 
        progressive, and at times openly anti-capitalist, but in reality are only a product of capitalism, they are idealistic, they reject and thus betray 
        the working class and is against class struggle, they are against the revolution that creates a new society, and is a symptom of the decline and 
        spread of the capitalist system in the transitional stage to neo-feudalism.</p>
      <p>It is also because of the perceived revolutionary or traditional sign that they pose, that these ideas are regularly smuggled into Vietnam and are 
        promoted by NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) in the form of non-political, academic, and scientific knowledge despite the unscientific and 
        counterrevolutionary essence of both these ideologies and the material realities from which they are produced. For example, it can be seen that a 
        lot of these "knowledge", "definitions", "theories" about gender and race that are being promoted heavily in the West are slowly making their presence 
        known in Vietnam. These ideologies, while looking benign on the surface, some of them even preach Marxism and class struggle, all masks the blatant 
        distortion of Marx's dialectical materialism and dialectical historicism under its surface, converting it back to nothing but bare dialectical idealism. 
        In these cases, the interests of the proletarian nation, and of social stability are completely out of the picture. The most dangerous thing is that 
        this &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; gradually has been and will still be absorbed by a generation of young people, students, intellectuals, middle class people, 
        those without class and revolutionary awareness. It reaches the right people through the Internet, through film culture, through music... coming from 
        capitalist countries. One sign of this phenomenon is the idea of Western Supremacy, the idea that things coming from the West can only be superior, the 
        political changes in the West are more progressive, more just, more democratic, more free&hellip; and the thought that Vietnam must therefore also follow 
        in that direction! The influence of these counter-revolutionary doctrines can also cause confusion among state and Party cadres, whose ideological stances 
        are not yet firm, causing them to yield to revisionism. This effect is true of both conservative and progressive forces.</p>

      <h3>The photo was posted by an NGO calling itself "Vietnam Gender Equality Promotion Organization (VOGE)", with implications that the Vietnamese government 
        concealed and whitewashed information in the case of false information being posted stating a HUFLIT student studying defense - 
        security education at Military School of Military Region 7 was raped.</h3>
      <p>We clearly see from practical and real examples that the influence of such forces is not small. In the recent past and even now, they are the forces 
        of &ldquo;peaceful evolution&rdquo;, "democracy protests", "civil society movements", &ldquo;multi-party system&rdquo;, the branded "right-wing" movements. 
        And now it also appears in the form of struggles for "gender equality", "gender diversity", "ethnic equality", "animal rights", etc. These movements 
        labeled "left wing" are emerging among the Vietnamese youth with increasingly sophisticated tactics that are difficult to expose and distinguish. The 
        common point in both of these is that these forces are ready to distort truth, make up stories, and spread false and malicious information in order to 
        insult, denigrate, and denounce the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam, denounce socialism and the path our Party and our people have chosen, 
        whenever they have the opportunity to, a &ldquo;now hidden, now open&rdquo; fight. &ldquo;Right wing&rdquo; movements cause instability and distrust 
        among the working class, while "left wing" movements cause instability in the bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and students. Without a complete understanding 
        of these forces, the danger of color revolutions, which in actuality is counter-revolution... is difficult to predict.</p>

      <h3> Lieutenant General Tran Hoai Trung chaired a meeting with media agencies during a meeting related to the spread of false information about a student of HUFLIT studying defense and security education at the Military School - Military Region 7 being raped. Among those who spread false information, most of them are students, young people, doing so under the label of "gender equality", many of these people then turn to unjustifiably criticize the Party, the state, that the state has been trying to withhold, cover up information. After being exposed as spreading fake news, these people remained stubborn, even thinking that they had "fought for justice" despite the recognition that they had willing spread fake news, and for they took it as “a fight”, the opponent here was none other than the Vietnamese government.

        <p>Faced with this situation, the recognition, evaluation and classification of the above subjects through the promotion and propagation of 
          Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh's thought and the acquisition of human achievements in a righteous and systematic manner with research, and 
          selective work is very important. In addition, the Party, the State, the people, you and I, must maintain our uncompromising stance and be 
          vigilant against the forces mentioned above. Echoing the fact: The Communist Party of Vietnam has always maintained the stance of creating 
          equal opportunities to live, work and develop for all Vietnamese citizens, regardless of gender, ethnic background or religion. Using the 
          ocialist-oriented market economy model, under the supervision of the Communist Party of Vietnam, as a tool to advance to a just and civilized 
          society, with a strong people and a strong nation, refuting all claims that the Vietnamese state institution causes injustice, hinders economic 
          development, and destroys national traditions. Above all, reality is always a perfect enemy for the opposing forces: As long as our Party, State 
          and people strive to improve the people's living situation, so that the people can have food to eat. clothing, education, strong family and 
          social stability, improving Vietnam's position in the international arena, making the name of the nation's glorious traditions... then any plot 
          to sabotage, to smear our revolutionary achievements are still just dreams and illusions!</p>
